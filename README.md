# Mathematical modeling of lightning

Simple mathematical modeling of lightning in 2D

Project realized in second year at the Institut National des Sciences Appliqu√©es (INSA) of Toulouse about the mathematical modeling of lightning in 2D on Python (inspired by a work realized for the Olympiades de Physique 2017-2018, https://odpf.org/images/archives_docs/25eme/memoires/EquipeT/memoire.pdf)

lightning_modeling: returns a .txt which displays the lightning impact points according to a grid of defined size and a convergence parameter, and a .npy, with the data returned by the main function.

fractal_dimension: from a set of .npy files, returns the mean fractal dimension as well as the empirical standard deviation of a lightning impact simulation for the same values of N, MAXDELTA and ETA (grid size and convergence parameters)
